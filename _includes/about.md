## Fun Things I've Done

- [itsme Keyboard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/itsme-keyboard-your-3d-avatar/id1121740967?mt=8): I created a Ruby Gem for creating animated GIFs of user's avatars, built a JSON API, and oversaw the design of the mobile apps.
- [The Compassion Project](http://compassionfortsum.ca/): A small charity with a big impact. I built The Compassion Project's website using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) and Foundation.
- [Sound Prints](/blog/2017/05/12/toronto-sound-prints/): I worked with another multi-media artist and a research lab to create visualizations of sonic stress environments.
- [Mobile Music Video](https://www.fastcocreate.com/3048010/fido-and-vice-create-a-mobile-music-video-tailored-to-each-viewers-location): I wrote Ruby scripts to create glitches in short videos for a music video with VICE magazine.
- [canitakemybikeonthettc.ca](http://canitakemybikeonthettc.ca/): My very first web app! I wrote this before I really knew anything about anything, but I still like it.
