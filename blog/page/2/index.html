        <p>
            A year or so ago, I taught myself PHP by way of WordPress. I didn&rsquo;t consider myself a developer, but I knew how to make things happen. When I learned Ruby on Rails, I was thrilled to realize that I actually understood the basic concepts of programming, and I picked up Ruby really quickly.
After learning Rails this winter, I was curious to see how much more I understood about PHP now that I had begun to work with Ruby, so I built a new site using Kirby.

        <p>
            I am working with two of my classmates to create an API for the City of Toronto&rsquo;s City Council data. We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time discussing the idea, and this week we got down to work.
Why Are We Doing This? A couple weeks back, I was chatting with Matt Elliot about the stories we might find in this data. He had a great example. Checkout the SmartTrack Work Plan from February&rsquo;s meeting.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This weekend I created a small, Ruby CRM application that stores contact information. You can check out my code on GitHub. While I was building this app, most people were using an array to store their contact information, but I wanted to use a Hash. I kew that theoretically Hashes are fster than Arrays, but I didn&rsquo;t know why.
Arrays vs Hashes The quick answer is that Hashes in Ruby are more easily accessible than an item in an array.
